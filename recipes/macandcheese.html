        <p>Looking for a homemade alternative to boxed mac

            it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>&frac14 cup butter</li>
            <li>&frac14 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>&frac12 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally until cooked through but firm to the 
                bite, 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over
                medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir 
                until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly,
                while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and 
                stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 
                minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <h3><strong>Cook's Note:</strong></h3>
            <p>You can never have enough cheese, 
                and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe.</p>
                
            <p>Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils 
                fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's 
                flavor if overcooked.</p>
        </ul>
